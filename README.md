# Welcome to TheDAO2.0!

TheDAO2.0 is an evolution of human organisation which is based on pseudoanonymous participation, digital contracts and decentralization.

## Background
Get some background about what DAO is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization).  
Essentially, TheDAO v1 failed. Although it did succeed to prove that it is possible and there is something in it. Just like the first attempts for aero flight failed in crash.
TheDAO2.0 aims to overcome the mistakes that were done in v1 and attempt to build a more professional and solid protocol for future DAOs.
TheDAO2.0 will attempt to be the first working decentralised, autonomous and code-based contracts organisation in the world.
The goal is to build sustainable organisation with clear vision, business plan and employees/contractors. 
Success will be marked if this organisation will meet those milestones:

 1. **Formation** - grouping individuals by common interest, collaborating and incentivised by fair contract)
 2. **Production** - individuals performing each his own duty, resulting in an assembled output
 3. **Distributing** - goods/outputs should be delivered to the crowd 
 4. **Sustainability** - goods/outputs should produce income in return, this income should be payed as reword for participating individuals and enabling growth
 5. **Growth** - the organisation should incrementally grow it's participating individuals and income

## How Does It Work
TheDAO1 was built on top of Ethereum. Ethereum is not the only way to implement smart contract. We're currently discussing about all possibilities and alternatives.
Essentially, the whole organisation will be defined with entities and relationships (contracts) between them.
